We are going to do API for the second screen of the App. 
First API : 
We will be displaying movies based on the users preference (Use Content Filtering )

Second API : 
We also will be displaying a list of most popular movies (Use Demographic filtering method)

If we notice our data we don't have the movie's poster link. 
We have a csv file (movie_links.csv) for that. 

We will be merging (movie_links.csv) with (movie.csv) and then we will create a csv named as (fin0al.csv)
with an extra column for poster_link

The new file name is merge_csv.py (code to merge two files)
